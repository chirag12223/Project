        <h3>
        Learning to Know</h3>

Learning to know is a lifelong learning process in which we acquire structured theories and principles; that is to increase our knowledge and broaden up our understanding. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p><h3>
        Learning to Do
    </h3>
        Inarguably, what we learn, as much as possible, should be put into practice. This is what we call learning to do.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <h3>
            Learning to Be</h3>

Learning to be means getting into the point of becoming what we are as what we aimed. Through learning to know and learning to do, we realized that our set goals are worked out; and guided with a direction, either aware or not, we move into a transition from practice of what we learned into achievement of what do we suppose to be.

            <h3>
            Learning to Live Together</h3>

In my perception, the first three pillars of learning focus on our lifelong learning as individuals. Now the fourth pillar, learning to live together, goes beyond our individual walls, and in here we engage ourselves into relationships with others, thus promoting social equity, justice, peace and harmony.
